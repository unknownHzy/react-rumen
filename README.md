This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# 这是一个react入门项目
### 这个工程主要涉及几个知识点
1. React父子组件
2. React父 -> 子 通信： 通过传递向子传递属性
3. React子 -> 父 通信： 通过调用父组件传递给子的function
4. 一些代码优化，包括在constructor中bind方法 （据说有性能优势）
5. React中使用CSS修饰，比较好的是className 
    还有一种是style={{background: red}} 外面{}代表JS表达式，里面{}代表是一个JS object
    ```javascript 1.6
    <button className='add-btn' onClick={this.handleBtnClick}>add</button>
 
    还有是
    <button sytle={{background: red}} onClick={this.handleBtnClick}>add</button>
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
